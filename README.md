# Automated File Organizer Script

## Description
This Python script automatically organizes files from a specified directory by moving them into folders based on their file extensions. It reduces manual effort in organizing files and helps maintain a cleaner, more structured file system.

## Features
- Automatically sorts files into folders based on their extensions (e.g., PDFs, PNGs).
- Supports easy customization to add more file types.
- Creates target folders automatically if they donâ€™t exist.
- Skips unrecognized file types and gives feedback on skipped files.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vivektsingh/automated-file-organizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd automated-file-organizer
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

That's it! No additional libraries are required since the script uses Python's built-in modules.

## Usage
1. Open the `automate_files.py` script in a code editor.
2. Change the `source_dir` and `target_dirs` to point to your desired directories.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python automate_files.py
    ```

## Customization
To add more file types or change target folders, simply modify the `target_dirs` dictionary in the script.

## Examples
If you have a `file.pdf` in your Downloads folder, the script will move it to `Documents/PDFs/`.
